### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Lukas.
Or Blue if you want to use my nickname. ðŸ’™

I am a specialized computer scientist in application development in Germany (Stuttgart).

For about 11 years now, i have been working on lots of projects of different sizes and each challenging in an unique way. Some of those projects can be found here :)

Right now i dedicate most of my free time to [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap#readme).
This tool generates a map from a minecraft-savegame, that then is viewable in a web-browser in full 3D. I started this project in 2018 and have been working on it since.
